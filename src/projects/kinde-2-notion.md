A Python package to export all the clippings from your Kindle device to a page in Notion. Run this script whenever you plug in your Kindle device to your PC.

A key inspiration behind this project was the notes saving feature on Google Play Books, which automatically syncs all your highlights from a book hosted on the service to a Google Doc in real time. I wanted a similar feature for my Kindle and this project is one step towards a solution for this problem.

Intended for:

- Avid readers who would want to browse through their prior reads and highlights anytime anywhere.
- For those who like to take notes alongside their highlights.
